## Introduction to Accounting Data Analytics and Visualization
### February 10, 2022

### Content
-  We bridge accountancy to analytics. 
-  We identified how tasks in the five major subdomains of accounting (i.e., financial, managerial, audit, tax, and systems) have historically required an analytical mindset, and we then explore how those tasks can be  completed more effectively and efficiently by using big data analytics. 
-  It was presented a FACT framework for guiding big data analytics: Frame a question, Assemble data, Calculate the data, and Tell others about the results.
-  It was emphasized the importance of assembling data. 
-  We demonstrateD and exploreD how Excel and Tableau can be used to analyze big data, also described visual perception principles and then apply those principles to create effective visualizations, then examined fundamental data analytic tools, such as regression, linear programming (using Excel Solver), and clustering in the context of point of sale data and loan data. 
-  We concluded by demonstrating the power of data analytic programming languages to assemble, visualize, and analyze data. We introduce Visual Basic for Applications  as an example of a programming language, and the Visual Basic Editor as an example of an integrated development environment (IDE).

## Accounting Data Analytics with Python
### March 10, 2022

### Content
- The first half of the course picks up where Introduction to Accounting Data Analytics and Visualization left off: using in an integrated development environment to automate data analytic tasks. We discuss how to manage code and share results within Jupyter Notebook, a popular development environment for data analytic software like Python and R. We then review some fundamental programming skills, such as mathematical operators, functions, conditional statements and loops using Python software. 
- The second half of the course focuses on assembling data for machine learning purposes.  We introduce students to Pandas dataframes and Numpy for structuring and manipulating data. We then analyze the data using visualizations and linear regression. Finally, we explain how to use Python for interacting with SQL data.
